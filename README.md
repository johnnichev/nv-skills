# nv:context

**Context engineering for engineers who ship.**

```bash
npx skills add johnnichev/nv-context -g -y
```

Auto-detects your tools, commands, and linters. Finds landmines with parallel agents. Generates configs, hooks, session management, and token budgets — so every AI coding agent works at maximum effectiveness.

> "Most agent failures are not model failures — they are context failures."

## The Problem

Your AI agent is smart. But it keeps running the wrong test command, touching files it shouldn't, and forgetting your rules mid-session. You've tried writing a CLAUDE.md. Maybe you ran `/init`. It didn't help — and research proves why:

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Auto-generated configs **reduce** success by 3% | ETH Zurich |
| Experienced devs are 19% **slower** with bad AI context | METR Study |
| 40%+ of AI project failures stem from poor context | IntuitionLabs |
| Using 40% of context window outperforms using 90% | Dex Horthy |
| A focused 300-token context beats unfocused 113K tokens | FlowHunt |

**Bad context doesn't just not help — it actively hurts.**

## The Solution

nv:context applies 200+ research sources to set up your repo correctly. In under 3 minutes:

1. **Interviews you** about your tools, pain points, landmines, and workflow preferences
2. **Analyzes your codebase** for non-obvious patterns, exact commands, and architectural gotchas
3. **Scores your setup** with the Hierarchy of Leverage framework
4. **Generates tailored configs** — only for tools you use, only content agents can't discover themselves
5. **Sets up hooks** for deterministic enforcement (auto-format, branch protection, PostCompact re-injection)
6. **Creates session management** — HANDOFF.md, .claudeignore, Document-and-Clear workflow
7. **Installs compounding engineering** — your codebase gets smarter with every PR review

## What Gets Generated

```
your-repo/
  AGENTS.md                         # Universal (25+ AI tools read this)
  CLAUDE.md                         # Claude-specific with @imports (<50 lines)
  tests/CLAUDE.md                   # Testing scope
  src/CLAUDE.md                     # Source scope
  HANDOFF.md                        # Session handoff template
  .claudeignore                     # Exclude irrelevant files from context
  .claude/settings.local.json       # Hooks (auto-format, branch protection, PostCompact)
  .cursor/rules/*.mdc               # Cursor scoped rules (if you use Cursor)
  .github/copilot-instructions.md   # Copilot config (if you use Copilot)
  .github/workflows/
    learn-from-reviews.yml          # Auto-learn from PR reviews
```

## Key Features

### Hierarchy of Leverage Scoring

Not just L0-L6 maturity — scores each layer independently:

```
Hierarchy of Leverage Score
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Verification        [██████████] 10/10
CLAUDE.md quality   [████████░░]  8/10
Hooks               [██░░░░░░░░]  2/10  <- biggest gap
Skills              [████████░░]  8/10
Subagent patterns   [░░░░░░░░░░]  0/10
Session management  [████████░░]  8/10
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overall             36/60

Top recommendation: Set up hooks for auto-format
and PostCompact re-injection to reach 48/60.
```

### Token Budget Report

Know exactly how much context you're spending before a conversation starts:

```
Context Budget Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
System prompt          ~2,500 tokens
CLAUDE.md              ~800 tokens
Skill descriptions     ~400 tokens
MCP tools              ~1,200 tokens
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Baseline cost          ~4,900 tokens
Available for work     ~123,100 (96%)
Status: HEALTHY
```

### PostCompact Context Re-injection

The #1 complaint: "my agent forgets rules mid-session." nv:context installs a hook that automatically re-injects critical context after compaction fires. Your landmines and boundaries survive context compression.

### Negative Instruction Detection

Research proves "don't use X" makes agents MORE likely to use X. nv:context scans your configs and rewrites:

```
BEFORE: "don't use moment.js"
AFTER:  "MUST use date-fns for all date operations"

BEFORE: "avoid raw SQL queries"  
AFTER:  "MUST use the ORM query builder for database operations"
```

### Compounding Engineering

Tag PR reviews with `@claude-learn` and the learning auto-creates a PR adding it to AGENTS.md. Your context improves with every code review.

### Multi-Level Hierarchy

Not just root configs — generates scoped files per directory:

```
CLAUDE.md              # Orientation (50-100 lines)
tests/CLAUDE.md        # Testing patterns, async rules
src/CLAUDE.md          # Import conventions, code patterns
src/api/CLAUDE.md      # API-specific patterns
```

Agents only load what's relevant to where they're working.

## The 8 Laws

Built into every file nv:context generates:

1. **Less is more** — every line must earn its place
2. **Landmines, not maps** — document what agents can't discover
3. **Commands beat prose** — snippets over paragraphs
4. **Context is finite** — 150-200 instruction budget
5. **Progressive disclosure** — layer context by need
6. **Hooks for determinism** — 100% compliance for critical rules
7. **Negative instructions backfire** — "MUST use Y" not "don't use X"
8. **Compact proactively** — 60% safe, 70% degrading, 85% hallucinating
